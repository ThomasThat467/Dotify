# Dotify by Thomas That

Dotify is a cloud-based music player application. You can listen to music, switch between tracks, see how many times you've played a certain track, and change users.

## Extra Credit

I have completed these extra credits:
1. A user is not allowed to apply a new username if the edit text field is empty.
2. Long pressing on the cover image changes the color of all the text views to a different color.
4. All hardcoded dimensions & colors are extracted into res/values/dimens.xml & res/values/colors.xml respectively
5. Instead of requirement #5, the album cover image must be a perfect 1:1 square size whose width matches the screen width and height matches the height as well.
