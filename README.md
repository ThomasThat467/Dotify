# Dotify by Thomas That

Dotify is a cloud-based music player application. Choose any song from the list as well as delete songs or shuffle them. To open the main player, just tap on the mini-player once you've selected the song.

## Extra Credit

I have completed these extra credits:
1. Show a stock Android back arrow button, ‚Üê, in the Header/Toolbar of Activity B. When clicked, it navigation back to SongListActivity
2. Long pressing on an item should delete that song on the list. It should show a Toast that says what song was deleted.
3. When a user presses shuffle, the list should animate the changes using DiffUtil
